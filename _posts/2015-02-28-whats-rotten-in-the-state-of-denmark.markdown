A few months ago [Danish(tm)][danish-tm] released a major update of their website. Since 2012, they have been promoting danish design and frequently posting beautiful content on social media. Their aim is to reveal what makes Denmark one of the top countries when it comes to design. Moreover, they like to keep a list of the most influential local design companies, [Normann Copenhagen][normann-copenhagen], [C.F. MÃ˜LLER][cfmoller] or even the [Lego Group][lego].
